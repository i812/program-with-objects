      <h2><b>Lesson 1: Basics of the Web & HTML</b></h2>

      <div class="section">
        <p>A webpage is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and interpret and display them.
        </p>

        <p>Coding means telling a computer what you want it to do in a way it can understand. Programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand, and the computer follows the instructions of the written text

        "Computers are Stupid"
        </div>

        <p>
        Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "Syntax"). One typo in the code can cause the whole thing to not work.

        <p>
          The World Wide Web was invented in the early 1990s.
          <br>A collection of HTML documents. HTML ties all content together with hyperlinks.
          <br>HTML: main document type of the web.

            HTML

          <p>
            HTML stands for <em><b>Hypertext Markup Language.</b></em>
            <br><br>HTML documents are the heart of the web. HTML documents contain text content <em>(what you see)</em>, markup <em>(what the content looks like)</em>, references to other documents <em>(images, videos, etc.)</em>, and links to other pages <em>(hyperlinks)</em>.
            <br><br><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340" target="_blank">This video</a> gives a good overview.

            Tags and Elements
          </div>

          <p>
            Tags are always contained within angled brackets
            <br><br>An opening tag is the left angled bracket, followed by the name of the tag, then the right angled bracket. A closing tag is the left angled bracket, followed by a slash ("/") and "the name of the tag, then the right angled bracket.
            <br><br>Most tags are structured with an opening tag and a closing tag. Some tags do not require a closing tag. These are called "Void" tags.
            <br><br>A tag as a whole is called an <b><em>element</em></b>. An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
            <br><br><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444" target="_blank">This video</a> explains the distinction between tags & elements well.

            Inline elements are just text.
            <br><br>Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them, which gives an extra line space.

            - A cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML (and other markup languages).
            <br><br>- When programmers talk about the "DOM" (Document Object Model), they are talking about the tree-like structure of a page. The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree.

    <h2><b>Lesson 3: Adding CSS to HTML Structure</b></h2>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="section-title">
        CSS - Cascading Style Sheet
      </div>

      <p>
        - Code written by programmers to control the style of related HTML elements, by giving similar HTML elements the same class name and then specifying the style that should apply to that given class.
        <br><br>- "Cascading means that rules are applied not only to the elements they directly match, but those elements' child elements. However, if a child element has multiple, overlapping rules defined for it, the more specific rule takes place.

    <div class="section">
      <div class="section-title">
        Avoids Repetition
      </div>

      <p>
        Repeatedly doing the same thing over & over in different HTML elements to give them a specific style results in repeated code or very similar code with minor differences. When changes need to be made, it is difficult to remember every place that style is repeated in the HTML elements. Having to manually make those changes in every location can lead to typos or errors, or result in a difference in style where the programmer might want the same style applied.
      </p>

      <div class="section-title">
        Consistency
      </div>

      <p>
        Specify a style for a given class in one place (CSS style sheet), and assign that class to multiple parts of the HTML document. This makes it easy to make changes to the styles, as you only have to make the change to the class in CSS, resulting in the same change to every part of the HTML document that class is assigned to.
      </p>

      <div class="section-title">
        Inheritance
      </div>

      <p>
        The mechanism by which properties are applied not only to a specified element, but also to its child elements.
        <br><br>Relies on the document tree, the hierarchy of HTML elements in a page based on nesting.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      It matters where you define the rules and in what order they are applied. Styles can be defined in different places. They are applied in the following order, with definitions further down the list overwriting previous definitions:
      <br><br>1. default stylesheet of a browser (different browsers have slightly different styles)
      <br><br>2. stylesheet in a separate file (what we will mostly be using)
      <br><br>3. stylesheet inside the HTML (can be done for small projects but not ideal)
      <br><br>4. inline style in an element (can also be done but should be avoided)

        A library usually refers to a collection of code made by others so it can be reused.<br>The Python standard library provides this functionality along with standardized solutions for problems that occur in programming. It has built-in modules that provide access to functionality otherwise inaccessible to Python programmers.

        A class is a logical grouping of data & functions (frequently referred to as "methods" when defined within a class).<br>A class is like a neatly packaged box that puts things together really well, a blueprint for creating objects.<br>A class is something that contains structure - it defines how something should be laid out or structured, but doesn't actually fill in the content.<br><br>An object is a particular instance of a class made up of variables, functions, and data structures.<br><br>An instance is a specific copy of the class that contains all the content, specifies what the content is.<br><br>Constructor is a special type of subroutine called to create an object and prepares the new object for use.<br><br>Self refers to the specific object being created from the class.<br><br>Class Attribute: a property of a class that is from composition and is usually a variable<br>There are five Predefined Class Attributes in Python:<br>-- <a href="http://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/courses/python/class/5/#classattrs">Python Predefined Class Attributes</a><br>Of these five, we learned specifically about three in this lesson:<br>1. __doc__ is used to provide documentation for a class. Add documentation information directly at the beginning of the class.<br>2. __name__ is used to get the name of the class.<br>3. __module__ is used to get the name of the module in which this class was defined.<br><br>Class Variables is a variable defined in a class. They are accessed by all instances of that class.<br>If a value of a class variable is a constant (will not change), the name of the variable should be in ALL CAPS to define a variable like that ("VALID_RATINGS" vs "valid_ratings")<br><br>Instance variable is a variable defined in a class, of which each object of the class has a separate copy.<br><br><a href="http://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/courses/python/class/5/#classinst">Class Variables vs. Instance Variables</a><br><br>Instance Method is a function defined inside a class & associated with an instance

        FINAL NOTES FOR CONNECTIONS MADE WITH OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING TO CSS & HTML
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
        CSS classes assign style to HTML. Any HTML file can use the same CSS stylesheet.<br>Abstraction in CSS is characterized by the fact that you can make significant changes to your HTML documents' look & feel without having to fully understand the underlying CSS functionality.
